title: Mews Documentation
---

The Mews Documentation is the publicly accessible product documentation both for Users and Developers working with Mews. We constantly update the documentation as the product develops and grows. Before contacting the Mews helpdesk, always check the documentation first, or visit the Frequently Asked Questions (www.mews.desk.com) 

Documentation is divided into 2 section:

1. **User Guide**: an indepth documentation of the Mews system functionality.
2. **Developers**: API's that allow external developers to link their products to the Mews Commander.
