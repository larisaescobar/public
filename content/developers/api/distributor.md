## Environments

### Test Environment

This environment is meant to be used during implementation of the client applications. We have prepared one hotel where you can fetch availability and create reservation. You can use the following information to access it:

- **Platform Address** - `https://demo.mews.li`
- **Hotel Id** - `3edbe1b4-6739-40b7-81b3-d369d9469c48`

You will also have access into the system so it is possible for you to check whether the reservations sent to the API are correctly posted to the system. To sign into the system, use the following credentials:

- **Address** - `https://demo.mews.li`
- **Email** - `distributor-api@mews.li`
- **Password** - `distributor-api`

### Production Environment

- **Platform Address** - `https://www.mews.li`
- **Hotel Id** - Depends on the hotel, should be provided to you by the hotel administrator.

## Images

To obtain URL of an image from `ImageId`, use `[ImageBaseUrl]/[ImageId]?Width=[Width]&Height=[Height]&Mode=[Mode]`, e.g. `[ImageBaseUrl]/1627aea5-8e0a-4371-9022-9b504344e724?Width=640&Height=480&Mode=1`. The `Width` and `Height` parameters are optional. The `Mode` paramater can have following values:

- `0` (Scale) - The image is rescaled to have exactly the specified dimensions. May change image aspect ratio.
- `1` (Cover) - The image is resized to cover the specified dimensions while keeping the aspect ratio. So the result might be larger than the specified size (only in one dimension). The result is smallest possible image that covers the specified size.
- `3` (CoverExact) - The image is resized and clipped to cover the specified dimensions while keeping the aspect ratio. So parts of the image might be missing from the result.
- `4` (Fit) - The image is resized to fit within the specified dimensions while keeping the aspect ratio. So the result might be smaller than the specified size. The result is largest possible image the fits into the specified size.
- `5` (FitExact) - The image is resized and padded to exactly fit within the specified dimensions while keeping the aspect ratio. So parts of the result image might be blank (black or transparent depending on the image format).

## Payment Gateway Data

To obtain `PaymentGatewayData`, you have to use client side encryption library provided by given payment gateway. You can find them here: 

- [Braintree](https://github.com/braintree/braintree-web)
- [Adyen](https://github.com/Adyen/CSE-JS)
