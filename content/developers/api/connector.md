title: Connector API (v1)
---

The Connector API serves as en endpoint for communication between MEWS and external systems. Or for applications that mediate communication between MEWS and the third party systems. Typically the external systems are running on site in the enterprise (e.g. POS systems, printers and other physical devices, kiosks etc), but the API may also be used by other cloud systems (e.g. revenue management systems, cloud POS systems). 

First of all, please have a look at [API Guidelines](../api.html) which describe general usage guidelines of MEWS APIs. If you are interested in changes and updates of this API, check [Changelog](#changelog). To see some scenarios when this API might be used, have a look at the [Use Cases](#use-cases) section.

## Authorization

All operations of the API require `AccessToken` to be present in the request. In production environment, the `AccessToken` will be provided to you by the enterprise admin. For development purposes, use the  [Demo Environment](#demo-environment).

### Environments

#### Demo Environment

This environment is meant to be used during implementation of the client applications.

- **Platform Address** - `https://demo.mews.li`
- **Access Token** - `C66EF7B239D24632943D115EDE9CB810-EA00F8FD8294692C940F6B5A8F9453D`

The enterprise is based in UK, it accepts `GBP`, `EUR` and `USD` currencies (any of them may be used), as a tax rate, either `0.0`, `0.05` or `0.20` can be used. The predefined accounting categories have codes: `FOOD`, `BVG` and `ABVG`. To sign into the system, use the following credentials:

- **Address** - `https://demo.mews.li`
- **Email** - `connector-api@mews.li`
- **Password** - `connector-api`

#### Production Environment

### Add Customer

Adds a new customer to the system and returns details of the added customer. If a customer with the specified email already exists, nothing is added to the system and profile information of the existing customer, which are left intact, are returned.

When it comes to dates in the customer data (e.g. birth date or passport expiration), they are all represented as dates in UTC timezone with time set to 12:00. That ensures that the date won't change no matter the timezone it is converted to. Practically it would be too complicated to obtain the timezone (e.g. timezone of place of birth or timezone of passport issuance) if we wanted to represent exact date and time in UTC.

## Use Cases

### Revenue Management System

Revenue management systems obtain information about reservations, revenue and pricing from MEWS. And based on the data they may recommend or directly update rate prices, give future revenue estimates, predict occupancy etc. In bigger hotels, there are might be more than 50k reservations in a year, so it is necessary to always limit the API calls in terms of potential data size, in order to avoid timeouts, network errors etc. A recommended approach, how to implement a RMS client is described below. Folowing these guidelines should ensure that both our servers and RMS clients are not unnecessiraly overutilized. 

#### Initial Data Pull

Performed once when setting up the connection, because the RMS needs to obtain historical data.
    
RMS should obtain the reservations in time-limitted batches using [Get All Reservations](#get-all-reservations) with [Reservation Time Filter](#reservation-time-filter) set to `Start`. Size of the batches depends on size of the hotel and its occupancy, but in general weekly batches are recommended and should work well even for big hotels (1000+ units). In order to get reservations e.g. in the past year, RMS should call [Get All Reservations](#get-all-reservations) sequentially 52 times (one call for each week in the past year). That would give RMS all reservations that have arrival within the past year.

To obtain revenue items associated with reservations, [Get All Reservation Items](#get-all-reservation-items) can be used. In order to prevent both huge responses, long response times or thousands of API calls, it should be called for batches of reservations (using `ReservationIds` parameter). One approach might be to call it once for each reservation batch returned in the previous step and therefore 52 times at most (if there is a week when there are no reservations, it does not have to be called for that week).

Sometimes the data obtained through the previous two steps are not sufficient enough for RMS. So additionally, RMS can pull e.g. business segments via [Get All Business Segments](#get-all-business-segments) or rates via [Get All Rates](#get-all-rates). Note that it is important to get the reservations and revenue first and the additional data later after that. If done the other way around, it might happen that RMS would receive a reservation with e.g. `RateId` which does not correspond to any rate that was pulled beforehand. Rates, business segments etc. are dynamic and hotel employee could create a new one and assign it to a reservation right before the reservation gets pulled to RMS.

#### Periodic Future Update

Performed periodically after the connection is set up so that RMS has future reservations and revenue up to date. Length of the period is not specified, but it is recommended to update the future data once or twice a day.

The workflow can be similar as during the initial data pull, just applied to future, not past. One can take advantage of the fact that reservations are usually booked a few weeks or months in advance. The further in future, the lower the occupancy, so the reservation batch length may increase with the distance to future from current date. E.g. weekly batches can be used only for the first three months of the future year when there is higher occupancy. And for the remaining 9 months, monthly batches would be sufficient. This would reduce the API call count from 52 to 21 (12 weekly batches + 9 monthly batches).

- Added `BaseRateId` and `ShortName` to [Rate](#rate).
- Added [Get All Reservations By Ids](#get-all-reservations-by-ids) operation.

#### 17th October 2016 23:00 UTC

- Removed the deprecated data fields and operations.
- Added `Start` and `End` [Reservation Time Filter](#reservation-time-filter).
- Added `ProductId`, `BillId` and `Type` to [Accounting Item](#accounting-item).
- Added `ServiceId` to [Reservation](#reservation).
- Added optional `BillId` parameter to [Add Credit Card Payment](#add-credit-card-payment).
- Added [Get All Services](#get-all-services) operation.
- Added [Get All Products](#get-all-products) operation.
- Added [Get Rate Pricing](#get-rate-pricing) operation.
- Generalized `Update Rate Base Price` to [Update Rate Price](#update-rate-price).

#### 1st September 2016 22:00 UTC

- Added operation [Update Rate Base Price](#update-rate-base-price) that allows e.g. revenue management systems to provide recommended rates to MEWS.
- Added operation [Get All Reservation Items](#get-all-reservation-items) that returns revenue items of selected reservations.
- Added `Currency` parameter to operations [Get Customers Open Items](#get-customers-open-items) and [Get All Accounting Items](#get-all-accounting-items).
- Deprecated operation [Get Customer Balance](#get-customer-balance). Operation [Get Customer Open Items](#get-customer-open-items) should be used instead, since it provides more complete information.
- Deprecated properties `Customer` and `Companions` on [Reservation](#reservation). `CustomerId` an `CompanionIds` should be used instead. The customer data are part of the result of [Get All Reservations](#get-all-reservations). This removes redundancy in the response data, especially in hostels where the customer is mostly the only companion and currently the customer data were twice in the result.
- We plan to make `Address` on [Customer](#customer) optional in order to reduce response sizes, in many cases the customers do not have address details filled in.
