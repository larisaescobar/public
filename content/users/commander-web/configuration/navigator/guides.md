title: Guides

The first step for the hotel is to create a guide.

It can be any type of a guide the hotel might want to create (e.g. Munich beer gardens, London film locations etc). Once the Create button is pressed, it is possible to add a picture, ordering (a position of the guide in the list) and then add places.
