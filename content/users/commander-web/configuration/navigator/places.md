title: Places
---

In case you want to add a place to your guides that does not exist (you were not able to find the required place in the list of places) you can create it.

Before adding a new place, make sure to double-check whether it was not created already, by searching for it beforehand (not to create duplicates). To do so, go to Places in the Settings menu (youâ€™ll find it under Navigator) and create your new place.

When creating a new place, all fields are required. Make sure to provide a nice description, price level, tags and a picture. 
 
All places in the system are shared between all of the properties using Mews. Although, the places are visible, guides are not.
