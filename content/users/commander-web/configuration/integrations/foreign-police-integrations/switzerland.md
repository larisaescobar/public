## Introduction

This user manual provides an insight into how an automatic generation of `Daily` and `Monthly` guest reports works in Mews and how to use it properly. The `Daily` report contains guests that have arrived that day to a hotel. A `Monthly` report contains the summary of arrivals/spent nights based on the nationality of the hotel's guests.

## Set up

- Provide at least one email address which will be the sender of the automatic reports (e.g. `manager@hotel.com`).
- Provide at least one email address to whom the notification to check Daily Customer Profile reports will be sent to (e.g. `reception@hotel.com`.

## Report Customer Profiles

Report Customer Profiles is accessible directly from *Dashboard* and it shows a list of customers that have arrived (or are In House) in the specified period - all based on the report's parameters. The proper filter for both reports is when one has selected to see "Arrivals" and selects the day/month period for `Daily`/`Monthly` reports.

This is a sample screen shot of the report. It shows that there are 2 guests in the room `203` - `John Smith` and `Last Name` (first name is missing), in the room `206` there is `Mena Suvari`, in the room `106` there is `Nicolas Cage` and some other uneassigned guest (the reservation is for 2 guests). 

The report states also:

- The profile of `Jane Smith` is 100% complete.
- Other profiles are missing some **Required** information.
- A companion of `Nicolas Cage` on room `206` is unassigned.

All missing required data should be filled in during check-in process. If something is still missing after check-in, it should be filled before the report is generated - see [How it all works](#how-all-works). The aim is to have the report fully 100% complete. The checking process should be set up in way that as much information as possible at the reseption during the guest's arrival.

*Note:* It is possible to download a report (that would be sent) or send the report directly via email for a selected day. In case a `Daily` report is generated and a larger period than one day is selected, the report is generated for the first day (Start) only.

### Incomplete report
[Customer Profiles](#report-customer-profiles) report is usually not 100% complete even after all reservations are checked in. If there is a guest profile missing some information (e.g. first name, nationality, date fo birth, passport number, address, ...) it should be looked up in the registration card, the guest should have completed during check-in, and fill in the missing data based on the card. If the registration cards is incomplete as well, it means that the reception didn't require it during check-in. The guest should be approached then. And more importatly the reception should be notified to require the whole registration card completed during check-in.

A bit more difficult (at least for Mews newbies) is to solve the problem with unassigned guest (room `206` case). What could happen:

1. The second guest won't arrive.
2. The second guest has arrived, but his profile hasn't been created.
4. Both guests have arrived, both profiles exist and are mentioned in the reservation detail, yet the main guest on the reservation is missing from the report.

#### Solution

1. Update the reservation to be only for 1 person (and apply a charge if necessary).
2. Create a new profile for the other guest and assign it to the reservation.
3. First just note that there is a difference between an *Owner* and an actual *Guest*. A *Guest* is someone who will stay in one reservation. The *Owner* of the reservation is the person who has created the reservation (and may not arrive at all) or in case of a multiple reservation group Mews doesn't know in which room the Owner will stay (a person can't stay in 2 different rooms), see the following screenshot:

![Group Modul](img/GroupModule.png)
The screenshot shows how to solve the room `206` case. `Nicolas Cage` is an *Owner* of the reservation. It is required to click on the `>` arrow (in red circle) to assign him to the reservation. It is up to reception durign check-in to assign the *Owner* to some reservation (make him a *Guest*).

## How it all works

Once everything is set up, automating the reporting can begin. There is an operation that runs in Mews in the background and every day at 9 am it:

- Send a notification email to check a report for **yesterday**.
- Send a `Daily` report via email of every customer that arrived on the **day before yesterday**.
- Send a `Monthly` report (if it is *2nd* day of month) for the **previous** month that contain:
	- report of spent nights grouped by nationality of guests
	- report of arrivals grouped by nationality of guests
