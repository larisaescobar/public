Whenever a hotel guest uses the Navigator mobile app, they have an option to request some services, message the hotel or browse city guides. City guides are collections of places that the hotel recommends to visit in some particular city.
 
The purpose of the app is to provide guests with a wider range of options generated by the hotel, compared to the traditional way where a concierge recommends only a handful of options.

To find out how to set up Guides and Places, please, navigate to the respective categories.
