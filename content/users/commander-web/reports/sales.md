With the Occupancy Report, Availability and Rate Management, we have tried to make the life of a revenue manager as easy as possible, as they have a lot of data to analyse. We combine occupancy, rate, availability and competitor rates in 2 easy reports that allow the management of inventory and rates. 

We do not currently offer a pickup report, segment by segment, day by day. However, all our reports can be exported to Excel and can be assigned Macros functionality, that would allow to build custom reports as per your requirements.
