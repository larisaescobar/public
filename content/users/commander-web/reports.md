Almost every report in Mews has a date selection and/or time selection.
Dates only: when there is a date selection only and you select the end date (for example 30th April) this will include the full end date as selected
Dates & Times: when there is both a date and a time selection on the report,be careful as often users forget to include the last day. For example if you try to run a report for April, you need to select
 - Start date: 01 April at 00:00:00
 - End date: 1 May at 00:00:00 (not the 30th April 00:00:00 as this will not include the last day)
