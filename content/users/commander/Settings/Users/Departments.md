Departments help the hotels to identify individual employees with the responsibilities they have and to distribute tasks and orders from guests accordingly.<br/>

### Examples of usual Departments:<br/>
- Housekeeping<br/>
- Maintenance<br/>
- Front Office<br/>
- F&B<br/>
- etc.

### How to use Departments?

Whenever manager (or other employee with **Manage Employees** privilege) creates a new employee, there is an option to assign a Department for this employee.

#### Tasks
When a task is created, there is an option to specify which Department would be responsible as you don't need F&B Department to be bothered by broken lights on the corridor. Anyone who checks the Task manager can easily filter out the Department he/she is responsible for and make sure that the task is done before the deadline.

#### Orders from guests
For every service in the hotel, you can assign **Responsible Department** who may either receive notification within the Commander or to receive email whenever this particular service is ordered. For example the Front Office department will be notified whenever a booking comes in Distributor or the F&B department is notified whenever a lunch or dinner is booked.<br/>
You can set up the responsible departments when you go to settings of each service > under the tab **Responsibilities**. To decide whether it would be notification or an email, you tick the respective option under the tab **Options**.
