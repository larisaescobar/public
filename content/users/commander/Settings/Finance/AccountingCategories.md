---

When setting up Accounting categories, you will most likely want to consult it with your accountants as this setup would be important mainly for them. Accounting categories in Mews serve to separate revenue accordingly for the needs of the hotel and its accountants or in some cases for some of the integrations that you may be working with.<br/>
Accounting categories also bring additional way how to look at the data in Mews' reports that deal with revenue -> Manager report and Accounting report. Where you can select the grouping based on *Service, Accounting category* and *Accounting category classification* (see below).</p>
Should you not be using any specific accounting system that requires deeper stratification or integration that specifically needs it, you don't need to bother with setting up the accounting categories.

### Code
