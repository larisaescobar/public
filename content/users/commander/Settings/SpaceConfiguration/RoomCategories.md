In this section Room categories can be created, to which later physical rooms shall be assigned.

**Space type:** specify the space type by choosing between apartment, bed, dorm, room or suite
 
**Name:** name of the room category
 
**Short name:** a short name for the room category. Important, because short names save much space in reports.
 
**Description:** It is important to have a description, if you are using the Mews Booking Engine. The Booking Engine will take the description directly from the PMS. 
 
**Ordering:**  the ordering is important if you want to show rooms in a particular order on the timeline (e.g. the lowest category rooms at the bottom, and higher category rooms above).
 
**Normal bed count:** a number of normal (fixed) beds this room type has
 
**Extra bed count:** a number of extra beds possible to set in the room
 
**Accounting Category:** an Accounting category can be assigned to a specific room type, if it is necessary to see revenue from rooms divided in some way.
 
**Room classification:** can be classified within the drop down list. It does not have further functionality within the system, therefore,  it is not a required field. 
 
**Reservation assignment strategy:** decide how to assign bookings within a hotel, as they come in
* **Bottom up:** the first booking will be assigned to the room 1, the second to the room 2 and so on.
* **Random:** spreads the amount equally across the hotel. Use it in case there is no need to fill the property floor by floor
* **Top down:** the bookings will be assigned from the highest room number to the lowest. 
 
**Channel manager id:** used for mapping to different Channel managers
 
**Order email template:** while the general confirmation emails do come from the system, sometimes, it is necessary to deliver additional information to the guests of certain room types. For example, if an apartment is located next to the hotel, you may add the information about a different entrance.
