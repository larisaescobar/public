title: Product rules
---  

With the Product rules feature you are able to automatically link Stay products to your rates. In other words, on this page you will learn about something commonly known as the **Packages**.

The product rules are to be used for both package rates such as Romantic Package that includes spa treatments and bottle of champagne as well as for e.g. adding City tax to all the leisure reservations or adding breakfasts to the B&B rates.

### Product rules setup
- **Priority:** Giving the Product rule high priority (*the lower number the higher priority*) will secure that this rule will be considered should there be (for whatever reason) some clash of rules.<br/>
E.g. that someone would set up that Breakfast is added to the B&B rate but at the same time there would be a rule which cancels Breakfast for the B&B rate.
- **Action:** Here you can either choose *Add* or *Cancel*. As mentioned above, this would secure that the product is either added or this product wouldn't be present if the conditions of the rule are met.<br/>
Adding a product is clear. Cancelling of a product may be used if e.g. you give free breakfasts only to the reservations on private rooms but not to bed reservations. Therefore, you would create a Product rule which *cancels breakfast when the reservation comes for bed* (see below).
- **Condition:** There are four types of conditions you can setup for the Product rules.<br/>
  1. **Business segment condition:** When you want specific product to be added/cancelled based on the business segmentation (e.g. City tax is applicable only for reservation coming with *Leisure* business segment).
  2. **Rate condition:** Probably the most common product rule condition. Managing products that are added/cancelled based on the rates (e.g. Museum tickets and Bike rental are added only to the *Explore the city* rate). 
  3. **Space category condition:** When the products should be added/cancelled based on 
  4. **Space type condition**



#### Good to know
- If your work with many Product rules and you want to see them ordered, you can group them by *Business segment, Product, Rate, Space Type, Space Category*.
