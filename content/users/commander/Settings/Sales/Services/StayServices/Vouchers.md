In this section you may set up Vouchers for both *corporate rates* as well as *special promo offers* which may attract more direct bookings to your property.

### Corporate rates
Your property may have a contract with some major or local corporation (or travel agent) for discounted bookings for their staff or clients. You don't want such rate to be publicly bookable and you want to have correct statistics of how many bookings you provided for specific companies.
- **What do you need before you set up the voucher**
1. You need to have a company set up (e.g. Best Company Inc.).
2. You need to have **private** rate set up (e.g. Best Company Rate -10%).

- **Setting up the voucher**
In order for this rate to be visible in the New reservation screen, you need to:
1. Click on creation of the new voucher.
2. Name the voucher (e.g. Best Company).
3. Select applicability (often you want to have it universally applicable, so you don't select the dates).
4. Assign the rate accoridngly (in this case Best Company Rate -10%).
5. Click on **Create**.

- **Booking corporate rate**
Go to the New reservaition screen and select the dates, Origin: **Company Direct**, Company: **Best Company Inc** and fill in the voucher into the respective field. Once you confirm it, new rate will appear in the selection.
