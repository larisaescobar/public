Space configuration section hosts tools for creating Room categories, Space features and physical rooms for hotels and hostels. 
 
When starting the creation process, the first step is to start with Room categories. Room categories are essentially types of spaces an enterprise has. After Room categories are created, proceed with Space features. Space features would outline additional details about particular units (e.g. the space may have seaview, shower, bathroom and so on). After Space features are set, proceed with creating physical rooms.
